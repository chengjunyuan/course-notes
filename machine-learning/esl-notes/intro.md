# Intro

**Statistical learning** plays a key role in many areas of science, finance, and industry.



A **supervised learning problem** uses a **training set** of data to train a **learner**, which then predicts an outcome measurement based on a set of **features**. In the **unsupervised learning problem**, we only observe the features and do not make predictions about the outcome; our task here is to describe how the data is organized.
