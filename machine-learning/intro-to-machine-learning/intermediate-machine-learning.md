# Intermediate Machine Learning

## Introduction

In this section, we go through:

* Tackle data problems (e.g., missing values, categorical variables)
* Design pipelines to improve the quality of machine learning code
* Perform cross-validation
* Use XGBoost
* Avoid data leakage

## Missing Values

There are several approaches to data with missing entries.

1. Drop columns with missing values
2. Imputation: filling in missing values with some number (e.g., the mean or median of that column)
3. Augmented imputation: add an extra column to denote imputed entries - this helps occasionally.
