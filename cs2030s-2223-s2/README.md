# Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

The main goal of CS2030S is to teach students how to be better programmers - how to write code that is both readable, and extensible by other programmers in the future. One of the ways we achieve this is through constructing and maintaining a **strong abstraction barrier**, and this first unit focuses on how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) enables us to build and maintain such an abstraction barrier. An abstraction barrier allows us to separate the role of a programmer into two:

1. The **implementer**, who implements the functions. Below the abstraction barrier, the implementer should focus on how the functions are going to work, to reduce the amount that is exposed to the client in later stages.
2. The **client**, who uses the function. Above the abstraction barrier, the client is only able to interact with functions through the inputs they give, and the outputs that the function returns. This reduces the amount of thinking work the client needs to do, and also prevents inexperienced clients from meddling with the implementation and breaking something fundamental in the program.
