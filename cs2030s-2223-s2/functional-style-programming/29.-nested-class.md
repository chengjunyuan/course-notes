# 29. Nested Class

### Nested Class

A **nested class** is a class defined within another containing class. We typically use nested classes as helper classes for more complex classes.

The nested class is a field of the containing class, and can therefore access the fields and methods of the container class, including those declared as `private`. We can keep the nested class within the abstraction barrier as well, through defining it as a `private` class. It is important that our nested classes belong to the same encapsulation as the container class, to prevent leaking of implementation details.

A **static nested class** is associated with the containing class, not an instance of the containing class. Static nested classes can therefore only access static fields and static methods, while non-static nested classes can access all fields and methods of the containing class. A non-static class is also known as an **inner class**.

### Local Class

We can also declare a class within a function. For example, we can define a class that implements the `Comparator` class inside a function that sorts an array.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
void sortNames(List<String> names) {
    class NameComparator implements Comparator<String> {
        public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
            return s1.length() - s2.length();
        }
    }
    
    names.sort(new NameComparator());
}
```
{% endcode %}

Classes like `NameComparator` that are defined within a method (or more precisely, inside a block of code sandwiched by `{` and `}`) are called **local classes**. Local classes are also scoped within the method, and have access to the variables of the enclosing class through the `this` keyword.

### Variable Capture

Recall that when a method returns, all local variables of the methods are removed from the stack. However, an instance of that local class might still exist. Therefore, the local class makes a copy of the local variables inside itself, which is known as **capturing** the local variables.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
interface C {
    void g();
}

class A {
    int x = 1;
    
    C f() {
        int y = 1;
        
        class B implements C {
            void g() {
                x = y;
            }
        }
        
        B b = new B();
        return b;
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Given the above classes and interfaces, we can then call `b.g()` through the following sequence.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
A a = new A();
C b = a.f();
b.g();
```
{% endcode %}

### Effectively Final Classes

Consider the following implementation of a sorting function.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
void sortNames(List<String> names) {
    boolean ascendingOrder = true;
    class NameComparator implements Comparator<String> {
        public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
            if (ascendingOrder)
                return s1.length() - s2.length();
            else
                return s2.length() - s1.length();
        }
    }
    
    ascendingOrder = false;
    names.sort(new NameComparator());
}
```
{% endcode %}

To avoid confusing code like this, Java only allows local classes to access variables that are explicitly declared `final` or implicitly final. An **implicitly final variable** is one that cannot be re-assigned after initialization. Therefore, the above code block is not allowed - `ascendingOrder` is not effectively final and the code therefore does not compile.

However, this only works for primitives, and reference types can be mutated. Therefore, our supposedly implicitly final variables can still be changed, causing our code to break. We therefore need to be careful about how we implement these features.

### Anonymous Class

An **anonymous class** is a class that is declared and instantiated in a single statement. It is called anonymous because it does not have a name. For example, we can shorten our sorting function to the following.

```java
names.sort(new Comparator<String>() {
    public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
        return s1.length() - s2.length();
    }
});
```

An anonymous class has the following format: `new X (arguments) { body }`, where `X` is a class that the anonymous class extends or implements, `arguments` are the arguments that you want to pass into the constructor of the anonymous class, and `body` is the body of the class as per normal.
