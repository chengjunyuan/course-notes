# 36. Monad

### Monads

A **monad** is a programming construct that obeys the following three laws:

1. Left Identity Law: `Monad.of(x).flatMap(x -> f(x))` must be the same as `f(x)`
2. Right Identity Law: `monad.flatMap(x -> Monad.of(x))` must be the same as `monad`
3. Associative Law: `monad.flatMap(x -> f(x)).flatMap(x -> g(x))` must be the same as `monad.flatMap(x -> f(x).flatMap(y -> g(y)))`

The key idea here is that the `of` method of the monad behaves like an identity, and the `flatMap` method must produce the same result, no matter the number of layers of nesting present.

To verify that a specific construct is a monad, we must check that they obey the three laws above.

### Functors

A **functor** is another common abstraction in functional-style programming. It is simpler than a monad, as functors only need to obey the following two laws:

1. Preserving Identity: `functor.map(x -> x)` is the same as `functor`
2. Preserving Composition: `functor.map(x -> f(x)).map(x -> g(x))` is the same as `functor.map(x -> g(f(x))`

The classes `Lazy`, `Maybe`, and `InfiniteList` are all functors.
