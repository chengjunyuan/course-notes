# 32. Lazy Evaluation

### Lambda as Delayed Data

When we write lambda expressions, as we just defining an expression and are not invoking a function. Lambda expressions therefore allow us to delay the execution of code, saving them until we need it later. This enables a mechanism known as **lazy evaluation**, where we build up a sequence of complex computations until we need to execute them. Consider the following `lazyLog` method.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
class Logger {
    enum LogLevel {INFO, WARNING, ERROR};    
    
    public static LogLevel currLogLevel = LogLevel.WARNING;
    
    static void lazyLog(LogLevel level, Producer<String> msg) {
        if (level.compareTo(Logger.currLogLevel) >= 0) {
            System.out.println(" [" + level + "] " + msg.produce());
        }
    }
}

Logger.lazyLog(Logger.LogLevel.INFO,
    () -> "User " + System.getProperty("user.name") + " has logged in");
```
{% endcode %}

The method `System.getProperty("user.name")` is now lazily called, only if the message is going to be printed.

### Memoization

Another way of being lazy is to not repeat outselves, i.e., to cache (or memoize) the values that we have computed again. This is useful only if the function is pure (as it guarantees that the outputs will always be the same).
