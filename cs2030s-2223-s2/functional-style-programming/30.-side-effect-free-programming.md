# 30. Side Effect-Free Programming

### Pure Functions

Mathematical functions have two nice properties that we would like to mimic in our code:

1. No side effects - they simply compute and return the value, without changing any existing variables or functions.
2. Referential transparency - if we define `a:=f(x)`, we can interchangeably use `f(x)` and `a` throughout the rest of our work, as they will be equivalent.

To write cleaner code, our methods should therefore be free of side effects and be referentially transparent. To achieve this, functions need to be **first class citizens** in our program, i.e., we can assign functions to a variable, pass it as parameters, return functions from functions, and so on.

A **pure function** is a function that does nothing else, and is free of side effects. Here are some examples of pure and non-pure functions.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
// pure function
int square(int i) {
    return i * i;
}

// impure function
int incrCount(int i) {
    return this.count + i; // if the count is not final,
                           // this may yield different results for the same i
}

// impure function
void incrCount(int i) {
    this.count += i;
}

// impure function
int addToQueue(Queue<Integer> queue, int i) {
    queue.enq(i);
}
```
{% endcode %}

Pure functions must also be deterministic, that is, the function must produce the same output every single time. This property helps to ensure referential transparency.

(Remark: in computer science, we refer to the style of programming where we build a program from pure functions as _functional programming_ (FP). One problem with Java is that it is not designed to be functional; it is designed as an object-oriented language at its core! As such, we refer to this style as _functional-style programming_.)

### Functions as First-Class Citizens

Consider the following `Transformer` interface:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
interface Transformer<T, R> {
    R transform(T t);
}
```
{% endcode %}

We can use this interface to write any function that takes in a value and return another value; we can in fact write a method `chain` that composes two computations together and returns a new computation!

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
<T, R, S> Transformer<T, R> chain(Transformer<T, S> t1, Transformer<S, R> t2) {
    return new Transformer<T, R>() {
        public R transform(T value) {
            return t2.transform(t1.transform(value));
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

### Lambda Expressions

Although we have written functions as first-class citizens, this is very ugly. A **functional interface** is an interface in Java with only one abstract method.  We can use the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation in our code, such as the following example.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Transformer<T, R> {
    R transform(T t);
}
```
{% endcode %}

A key advantage of functional interfaces is that there is no ambiguity about which method is being overriden by an implementing subclass.

Consider the following three sets of code, which are equivalent.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
Transformer<Integer, Integer> square = new Transformer<>() {
    @Override
    public Integer transform(Integer x) {
        return x * x;
    }
};

Transformer<Integer, Integer> incr = new Transformer<>() {
    @Override
    public Integer transform(Integer x) {
        return x + 1;
    }
};
```
{% endcode %}

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
Transformer<Integer, Integer> square = (Integer x) -> {return x * x;};
Transformer<Integer, Integer> incr = (Integer x) -> {return x + 1;};
```
{% endcode %}

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
Transformer<Integer, Integer> square = x -> x * x;
Transformer<Integer, Integer> incr = x -> x + 1;
```
{% endcode %}

The three sets are increasingly short, but they all mean the same thing. These are known as **lambda expressions**. Lambda expressions are useful for specifying a new anonymous method, such as the following `dist` method.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
Point origin = new Point(0, 0);
Transformer<Point, Double> dist = p -> origin.distanceTo(p);
```
{% endcode %}

Alternatively, we can use a **method reference**, which is when we specify functions using the double-colon `::` notation.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
Transformer<Point, Double> dist = origin::distanceTo;
```
{% endcode %}

Take note that when declarations like `x::compareTo` are called, then Java will throw a compilation error if there are multiple matches, or if there is ambiguity in which method matches.

### Curried Functions

At the simplest level, functions take in only one value and returns one value. Unfortunately, functions in programming frequently take in multiple arguments. Thankfully, we have a way to break down functions that take into multiple arguments into functions that take in a single argument at a time. Consider the following addition example:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

Transformer<Integer, Transformer<Integer, Integer>> add = x -> y -> (x + y);
```
{% endcode %}

Observe that `add` is no longer a function that takes two arguments, but is now a **higher-order function** that takes in a single argument and returns another function. This technique of converting a function to a sequence of many unary functions is called **currying**, and the functions generated are called **curried functions**. Currying is very useful because it helps us to partially apply a function first, save the partial results as a function, and continue applying them later.

Take note that lambda expressions store more than just the function to invoke, but also the data from the environment where it is defined. We call a construct that stores a function together with the enclosing environment a **closure**.
