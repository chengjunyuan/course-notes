# Motivating Examples

Many things can be modelled as systems of linear equations. We give some simple examples here to motivate our later discussions of systems of linear equations.

**Example 1.** The combustion of glucose can be written as the following chemical equation

$$
aC_6H_{12}O_6+bO_2\to cCO_2+dH_2O
$$

where $$a,b,c,d$$ are all unknowns. To balance this equation, we obtain the following set of equations

$$
6a=c\\12a=2d\\6a+2b=2c+d
$$

that we need to solve. (One possible solution is $$a=1,b=6,c=6,d=6$$)

**Example 2.** A farm needs to produce animal feed, which is a mix of corn and soybean meal. The feed requires at least 30% protein and at most 5% fibre, with the corn and soybean having the following nutritional properties

| Feedstuff    | Protein (% by mass) | Fibre (% by mass) | Cost ($ per kg) |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Corn         | 9                   | 2                 | 0.30            |
| Soybean meal | 60                  | 6                 | 0.90            |

We now want to minimize the cost of producing our animal feed, which can be formulated as a set of linear equations.

**Remark.** The purpose of these two examples is to demonstrate the ability of systems to be modelled as a set of linear equations. We now formalize this idea of a system of linear equations in the next section.
