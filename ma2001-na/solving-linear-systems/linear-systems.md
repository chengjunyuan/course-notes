# Linear Systems

**Definition 1.1.1.** A _linear equation_ in $$n$$ variables $$x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$$ has the form

$$
a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n=b
$$

where $$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$ and $$b$$ are real constants. The variables of the equation are called the _unknowns_.

**Definition 1.1.6.** A finite set of linear equations in the variables $$x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$$ is called a _system of linear equations_ (or a _linear system_)

$$
\begin{cases}a_{11}x_{1}+a_{12}x_2+\cdots+a_{1n}x_n=b_1\\a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+\cdots+a_{2n}x_n=b_2\\\vdots\\a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+\cdots+a_{mn}x_n=b_m\end{cases}
$$

where $$a_{11},a_{12},\ldots,a_{mn}$$ and $$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m$$ are real constants. Given $$n$$ real numbers $$s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_n$$, we say that  $$x_1=s_1,x_2=s_2,\ldots,x_n=s_n$$ is a _solution_ to the system if it is a solution to every equation in the system. The set of all solutions is called the _solution set_ of the system and an expression that gives us all these solutions is called a _general solution_ for the system.
